IP Address Tracker - Frontend Mentor

I have built this Web app as a part of Frontend Mentor Challenge.
I have used HTML, TAILWIND CSS along with APIs to rendor the details of IP addresses.

About Challenge: 
The challenge is to build out the IP Address Tracker app and get it looking as close to the design as possible. 
To get the IP Address locations, I am using the IP Geolocation API by IPify.
To generate the map, I am have used LeafletJS.

The users should be able to:
1. See their own IP Address on the map on the initial page load
2. Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location
3. View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
4. See hover states for all interactive elements on the page.
